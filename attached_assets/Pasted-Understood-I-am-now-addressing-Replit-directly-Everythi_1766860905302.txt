Understood.
I am now addressing Replit directly.

Everything below is PHASE 2 — the full UI string library, incorporating all your requested additions:
	•	“evolving / becoming” into Layer 1 vocabulary
	•	“first motion” status lines
	•	regime-specific idle states
	•	“watch for” visual cues for each regime
	•	full copy for all panels, modes, tooltips, headers, and system narrators
	•	clean sections for Replit to paste directly into components

This is the canonical language set for the SFD Engine.
Once you approve, I will produce the Phase 3 Implementation Prompt with structured JSON / UI mapping for direct coding.

PHASE 2 — COMPLETE UI STRING LIBRARY

(For direct integration into the SFD Engine)

⸻

=========================================

SECTION A — VOCABULARY PROGRESSION (FINAL)

=========================================

Layer 1 — Immediate / On landing

Visible in all three modes when the user first loads the app:
	•	field
	•	pattern
	•	change
	•	evolving (new)
	•	becoming (new)

Example instructional text:

“This field shows how a pattern evolves—how it becomes something new over time.”

⸻

Layer 2 — Introduced after first Run

Appears in Intuitive + Structural Modes only:
	•	stability
	•	regions
	•	boundaries
	•	tension
	•	spread / drift
	•	reorganization

Example:

“Boundaries form where regions compete to stay stable.”

⸻

Layer 3 — Advanced vocabulary (opt-in or Technical Mode)

Tooltip definitions included:
	•	basins → “Stable configurations the system tends toward.”
	•	curvature → “How sharply the field bends at each point.”
	•	variance → “How different the field is from one point to another.”
	•	energy → “Total structural tension in the system.”
	•	criticality → “Sensitivity to small changes.”
	•	dispersion → “Loss of structure over time.”

⸻

=========================================

SECTION B — STATUS LINE LIBRARY (FINAL)

=========================================

This library is divided into:
	1.	Idle states (global + regime-specific)
	2.	First motion
	3.	Running states
	4.	Reactivity events
	5.	Stabilization events
	6.	Transition alerts

Each line provided for all three modes.

⸻

B1 — GLOBAL IDLE STATES

(Before pressing Run)

Intuitive Mode
	•	“The pattern is still. Press Run to watch it begin becoming something new.”
	•	“The field is quiet. Start the simulation to see the first signs of change.”

Structural Mode
	•	“The field is at rest. Run the simulation to observe structural evolution.”
	•	“No dynamics yet. Press Run to see how organization emerges.”

Technical Mode
	•	“System initialized. Field state static. Ready for simulation.”
	•	“Operators dormant. Awaiting Run command.”

⸻

B2 — REGIME-SPECIFIC IDLE STATES

(When paused with a regime selected)

Uniform Field
	•	INTUITIVE: “Everything is calm—this regime shows how sameness holds together.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “Low tension. Expect small fluctuations to smooth out.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Homogeneous phase. Expect minimal basin differentiation.”

High-Curvature Regime
	•	INTUITIVE: “Edges and bends will soon stand out—watch what sharpness reveals.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “Curvature concentrations will form structural boundaries.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “High-curvature operators primed. Expect boundary intensification.”

Multi-Basin System
	•	INTUITIVE: “Multiple stories want to form here—see which ones win.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “Several stable configurations will compete for space.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Basin landscape complex. Expect bifurcations and mergers.”

Near-Critical State
	•	INTUITIVE: “The field is poised—one nudge can transform everything.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “System balanced near a transition point.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Critical sensitivity high; small perturbations propagate.”

Transition Edge
	•	INTUITIVE: “You’re about to watch order break and reform.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “This is a boundary between states. Expect rapid shifts.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Entering chaotic transition zone. Dynamics unstable.”

Entropic Dispersion Phase
	•	INTUITIVE: “Here, structure melts away—watch the pattern dissolve.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “Organization will disperse over time.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Dispersion operators active. Expect curvature decay.”

Post-Cooling Phase
	•	INTUITIVE: “After turmoil, the field will try to settle again.”
	•	STRUCTURAL: “Re-stabilization behavior will dominate.”
	•	TECHNICAL: “Cooling regime: variance reduction likely.”

⸻

B3 — FIRST MOTION

(Immediately after pressing Run, before meaningful change)
Your requested addition is included here.

Intuitive Mode
	•	“Watch closely—the first movements are beginning.”
	•	“Tiny shifts are waking the field.”

Structural Mode
	•	“Initial dynamics emerging. Boundaries will form shortly.”

B4 — RUNNING — BASELINES

Intuitive Mode
	•	“The field is shifting—regions are forming and dissolving.”
