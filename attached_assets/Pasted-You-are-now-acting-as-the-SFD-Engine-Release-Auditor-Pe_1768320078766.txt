You are now acting as the SFD Engine Release Auditor. Perform a full pre-export validation and cleanup of this entire project.

Your tasks:

1. **Repository Audit**
   - Scan all directories and list every file.
   - Identify unused, orphaned, duplicate, temporary, or outdated files.
   - Identify any dev-only artifacts (.map files, .DS_Store, scratch code, unused assets, console.log dumps, WIP files).
   - Identify any files in /client/src/components or /lib that are not referenced anywhere.

2. **Dependency & Import Validation**
   - Scan the entire codebase for unused imports.
   - Detect dead code paths.
   - Detect mismatched or missing imports.
   - Identify functions that are defined but never used.
   - Confirm there are no circular dependencies in the client or server modules.

3. **Build Integrity Check**
   - Run the TypeScript compiler in strict mode and list all warnings or errors.
   - Verify that the production build (npm run build) compiles without errors.
   - Confirm all assets referenced by the build actually exist.
   - Detect any mismatched or missing environment variables.

4. **Runtime Sanity Check**
   - Launch the dev server.
   - Observe the console for:
        - undefined accesses
        - NaN in simulation loop
        - uninitialized state
        - failing React effects
        - failing canvas renders
   - Run a 60-second simulation and ensure no render or logic errors appear.

5. **Tree Shaking & File Minimization**
   - Identify any code that can safely be removed.
   - Remove any unused assets, scratch folders, staged-but-unused modules.
   - Ensure the final build only includes what is required for production.

6. **Final Export Packaging**
   - Verify that the export zip will include:
        - /client
        - /server
        - /shared
        - package.json
        - tsconfig.json
        - vite.config.ts or next.config.js (whichever applies)
        - README.md

   - Verify that NO dev caches or build artifacts are included:
        - node_modules
        - dist
        - .replit
        - .cache
        - .npm
        - scratch pads
        - VSCode settings (unless required)

7. **Generate a Final Report**
   - Produce a structured report with the following sections:
        A. Files removed
        B. Files kept
        C. Unused imports removed
        D. Dead code eliminated
        E. Build warnings/errors fixed
        F. Runtime observations
        G. Recommended remaining changes (if any)
        H. Confirmation of export-readiness
