Understood.
Below is the fully rewritten, consolidated, production-ready Replit prompt, now including:

✅ all prior UI/UX restructuring

✅ onboarding flow

✅ colormap + visual defaults

✅ structured metrics surfacing

✅ interpretation modes

✅ new Lay / Intuitive Mode (strictly controlled vocabulary)

✅ accessibility improvements

✅ cognitive-flow optimization for “absolute novelty → comprehension → awe”

This is copy-paste ready for Replit.

📦 FULL REPLIT PROMPT — SFD Engine v1.1 (with Intuitive Mode)

Paste this directly into Replit’s prompt window:

⸻

🚀 SFD ENGINE — UI & EXPERIENCE REWRITE PROMPT

You are upgrading the UI of the SFD Engine.
Your job is to restructure the entire interface to create the ideal first-time user experience while preserving all mathematical fidelity.

The tool must guide a new user from:
“What is this?” → “I understand the structure.” → “Oh my god.”

Implement ALL of the following changes exactly:

⸻

1. DEFAULT VISUAL INITIALIZATION
	•	Set the default colormap to “Viridis”, not Inferno.
This reduces perceptual threat and makes subtle gradients visible immediately.
	•	Initialize the simulation paused, displaying a calm, balanced field.
The first visible state should invite exploration, not alarm.

⸻

2. PANEL LAYOUT REORGANIZATION

A. TOP BAR
	•	Title: SFD Engine — Structural Field Explorer
	•	Subtext: “Explore how local operators shape global structure.”
(This stays in all modes.)

⸻

B. RIGHT SIDEBAR (PRIMARY CONTROLS)

Organize into collapsible sections IN THIS ORDER:

⸻

(1) “Run Controls”
	•	Run / Pause button (large, centered, purple)
	•	FPS indicator
	•	Step button (single-step execution)
	•	Clear button

This must be visually dominant — this is where new users will look first.

⸻

(2) “Visualization”
	•	Colormap dropdown (default Viridis)
	•	Toggle: Show Basins
	•	Toggle: Dual View
	•	Toggle: Grid Overlay (new)
	•	Toggle: Invert Field (new)

This is where users manipulate the “appearance,” not the math.

⸻

(3) “Interpretation Mode”

A three-option dropdown:
	1.	Technical (Default for researchers)
	2.	Structural Dynamics
	3.	Intuitive Mode (Lay Mode)

Behavior:

Switching modes only changes descriptive text, not math or simulation parameters.

⸻

(4) “Presets & Regimes”

Dropdown of structural presets:
	•	Uniform Field
	•	High-Curvature Regime
	•	Multi-Basin System
	•	Near-Critical State
	•	Transition Edge
	•	Entropic Dispersion Phase
	•	Post-SRE Cooling Phase

Selecting a preset:
	•	Updates parameters
	•	Updates field initialization
	•	Updates the “Interpretation Sentence” (see Section 3)

⸻

(5) “Real-time Metrics” (Collapsed by default)

This panel should start closed, because it is visually heavy.
When opened, display:
	•	Structural Basins: number
	•	Depth: value
	•	Curv: curvature
	•	TVar: tension variance
	•	Stability: scalar
	•	Field Energy
	•	Local Variance

Metrics should be grouped visually with micro-labels.

⸻

(6) “Timeline”
	•	History sparkline
	•	“Reset Timeline” button
	•	Hover-to-scrub state preview (if supported)

⸻

3. INTERPRETATION SENTENCE (NEW)

Place a one-line interpretive description directly above the visualization.

This sentence updates dynamically based on Interpretation Mode.

You must implement all three mappings:

⸻

A. Technical Mode

Use mathematically accurate terminology.
Example:

“Local operator dynamics are increasing curvature and reducing structural variance.”

⸻

B. Structural Dynamics Mode

Use domain-general scientific language.
Example:

“Local interactions are causing the field to bend more sharply while stabilizing its overall pattern.”

⸻

C. Intuitive Mode (Lay Mode)

Use safe, non-metaphorical vocabulary.
No psychology, no physics metaphors, no intent.

Example:

“The pattern is becoming more uneven in some areas while settling into a stronger overall shape.”

Rules for Intuitive Mode vocabulary:
	•	Allowed: shape, bend, spread, merge, split, settle, uneven, stable.
	•	Forbidden: emotion words, intention words, body metaphors, agent language.
	•	Must never imply mind, motive, force, or causal agent.

⸻

4. LEFT SIDEBAR (NEW USER ONBOARDING)

Create a three-step onboarding flow the first time the user opens the tool.

Step 1 — “What You’re Seeing”

Explain that the central panel is a dynamic structural field.
Use the Intuitive Mode vocabulary.

Step 2 — “How to Interact”

Point to the Run button.
Explain how the field evolves when local rules are applied.

Step 3 — “What to Try First”

Guide users to:
	•	Switch colormap
	•	Toggle “Show Basins”
	•	Load a preset

After onboarding completes, store a boolean to never show again.

⸻

5. BASELINE CODE REQUIREMENTS
	•	All UI changes must update reactively.
	•	Interpretation sentence updates must never block simulation.
	•	Metrics panel collapsed by default.
	•	Presets load instantly.
	•	Simulation state must be preserved when switching Interpretation Modes.
	•	No mode is allowed to change the math, only the labels.

⸻

6. RESPONSIVENESS & AESTHETICS
	•	Smooth transitions for collapsible panels
	•	Use consistent spacing, 12px padding
	•	Keep everything aligned to a 4px grid
	•	Use light, subtle borders (rgba opacity < 0.2)
	•	Ensure the field canvas dominates the screen (60–70% width)

⸻

7. ACCESSIBILITY
	•	Provide high-contrast colormap variants
	•	ALT text for menus
	•	Keyboard shortcuts:
	•	Space = Run/Pause
	•	B = Basins toggle
	•	D = Dual View
	•	R = Reset Timeline

⸻

8. IMPLEMENTATION STYLE

Use modern React + Tailwind or equivalent.
Keep logic modular:
	•	/components/ui
	•	/components/interpretation
	•	/state/engine
	•	/state/ui

⸻

9. FINAL STATE — EXPECTED OUTPUT

When you finish executing this prompt, the SFD Engine should:
	•	Feel calm and welcoming on first load
	•	Clearly communicate what the user is seeing
	•	Offer deep expert controls without overwhelming novices
	•	Maintain scientific neutrality across all modes
	•	Create a natural, guided arc toward insight and awe

Your output should include:
	1.	Full updated App.jsx or equivalent container file
	2.	All components implementing the above
	3.	Working Interpretation Mode system
	4.	Onboarding modal logic
	5.	Minimal CSS overrides if necessary
	6.	Strict adherence to vocabulary rules in Intuitive Mode
