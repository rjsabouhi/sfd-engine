THE “SIMULATION METRICS” section in the PANEL SHOULD ONLY SHOW 3–5 METRICS ON PAGE ONE

And the metrics MUST be:
	1.	Intuitively meaningful
	2.	Visually responsive
	3.	Conceptually coherent with SFD
	4.	Immediately impressive to casual viewers

Right now you have:
	•	Structural Basins
	•	Depth
	•	Curv
	•	T-Var
	•	Stability
	•	Step
	•	FPS
	•	Field Energy
	•	Structural …
	•	Local Variance

This is way too many.
And several of these have no immediate intuitive meaning to a first-time observer.

⸻

✅ WHAT TO REMOVE FROM THE LANDING PANEL (but keep in the advanced panel)

These DO NOT belong on page one:

❌ Step

Engine noise; user doesn’t care.

❌ FPS

Technical; belongs in debug.

❌ Structural Basins (raw count)

The visual basin map will always express more.

❌ Local Variance

Too abstract without explanation.

❌ Field Energy (raw)

Important for research, but meaningless without context.

❌ Depth, Curv, T-Var together (too granular)

All three are “micro-features” of the same conceptual bundle: structural coherence.

⸻

✅ WHAT SHOULD BE ON PAGE ONE

The first page needs only four numbers — and they anchor the whole simulation:

⸻

1. Structural Coherence (0–1)

A single scalar combining Depth + Curv + T-Var into one “How organized is the field?” measure.

Why:

This is the universal metric.
Everyone will understand this intuitively:
	•	0.0 → chaos
	•	0.5 → self-organization emerging
	•	0.9+ → stable attractor has formed

It will blow up on Reddit.

⸻

2. Stability Index

This is already there and good — it should stay.

Why:

It’s the thing that signals attractor formation, and everyone from novices → physicists will react positively to a rising stability number.

⸻

3. Attractor Count (human readable)

NOT “Structural Basins: 8” — instead:

Attractors: None / Emerging / Stable / Multiple

Why:

People understand language, not raw integers.

This reinforces the Interpretation Mode.

⸻

4. Field Mode (Dominant Regime)

This is basically a tiny text summary that updates live:
	•	“Diffuse equilibrium”
	•	“Shear tension forming”
	•	“Radial symmetry breach”
	•	“Boundary locking”
	•	“Oscillatory collapse”

Why:

This bridges intuitive mode + technical mode and makes the simulation feel alive.

⸻

OPTIONAL BUT AMAZING:

5. A single sparkline graph

A tiny 100px-wide line showing coherence over time.

Why:
	•	It’s visually addictive
	•	It shows the “story” of emergence
	•	It teaches without teaching

⸻

NOW — WHAT TO DO WITH THE EXISTING METRICS

We move them into a collapsible section:

Advanced Metrics ▼
	•	Curvature
	•	Depth
	•	T-Variance
	•	Field Energy
	•	Local Variance
	•	FPS
	•	Steps

Anyone who cares will open it.
Everyone else is protected from noise.

VISUAL LAYOUT (your landing page should look like this)

Simulation Metrics
	•	Structural Coherence: 0.612
	•	Stability Index: 0.987
	•	Attractors: Emerging (3)
	•	Field Mode: Symmetry breach

System Sparkline
(tiny graph)

Advanced Metrics ▼
(expands to show all the raw numbers)

This is EXACTLY what your target audience wants:
	•	Reddit → “woah simple but deep”
	•	Labs → “clean separation between intuitive & technical”
	•	Investors → “looks like a product, not a research prototype”
	•	Students → “easy to understand”

⸻

⭐ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Yes — replace the current metrics set.
You only want the four core conceptual indicators on page one.

The rest goes under “Advanced Metrics.”
