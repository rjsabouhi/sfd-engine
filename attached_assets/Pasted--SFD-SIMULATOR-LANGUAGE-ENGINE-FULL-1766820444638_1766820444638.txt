SFD SIMULATOR LANGUAGE ENGINE — FULL TEXT PAYLOAD (v1.0)
==========================================================
This file defines ALL textual content for the SFD Simulator.
It includes:
- Three communication modes: TECHNICAL, STRUCTURAL, INTUITIVE
- All labels, tooltips, onboarding text, warnings, and regime definitions
- All metric descriptions across modes
- All UI strings required to populate the entire interface

Every string is structured as:
LANGUAGE.MODE.KEY = "text"

You will load this file into your front-end state system
and call it dynamically based on the user's selected mode.

    WELCOME_TITLE: "Welcome to the Structural Field Dynamics Simulator",
    WELCOME_BODY_INTUITIVE:
      "This tool lets you explore how complex systems shift, adapt, stabilize, or reorganize. You're looking at a living model of how structure changes when pressure builds or patterns destabilize.",
    WELCOME_BODY_STRUCTURAL:
      "This simulator models constraints, gradients, micro-fluctuations, and phase transitions as a unified dynamic field. You will see how local tensions accumulate, disperse, or reorganize the entire system.",
    WELCOME_BODY_TECHNICAL:
      "This interface exposes operator-level field metrics: local gradient magnitudes, instability thresholds, constraint curvature, spectral pressure, transition edges, and post-critical smoothing regimes. Ideal for advanced analysis.",

    /* ---- FIELD GRADIENT (FG) ---- */

    FG: {
      LABEL: "Field Gradient (FG)",

      INTUITIVE:
        "How fast things are changing in this area. High FG means the system is tugging, stretching, or shifting strongly.",
      STRUCTURAL:
        "Gradient intensity showing how sharply local conditions differ from their surroundings. High FG indicates tension buildup and pre-transition behavior.",
      TECHNICAL:
        "∂Φ/∂x magnitude. A measure of local differential steepness in the constraint field, identifying micro-instability vectors.",

    CC: {
      LABEL: "Constraint Curvature (CC)",

      INTUITIVE:
        "How ‘bent’ or ‘warped’ the local structure is. Higher curvature = more structural strain or compression.",
      STRUCTURAL:
        "Measures the deviation of local structure from equilibrium geometry. High CC signals structural folding or incipient reconfiguration.",
      TECHNICAL:
        "κ = ∇·(∇Φ). Second-order curvature operator indicating local compressive or expansive constraint topology.",

    TI: {
      LABEL: "Tension Index (TI)",

      INTUITIVE:
        "How much stress is stored here. High tension means the system is holding more than it prefers.",
      STRUCTURAL:
        "Represents stored structural energy that has not yet dispersed. High TI typically precedes a field-wide reorganization.",
      TECHNICAL:
        "TI = ||∇Φ|| weighted by local constraint density. Indicates metastable stress accumulation.",

        "A boundary contour where local instability surpasses smoothing forces. The system becomes sensitive to perturbations.",
      TECHNICAL:
        "TE is the manifold region where λ_min(J) approaches 0. A soft bifurcation zone indicating criticality proximity.",

      INTUITIVE:
        "How close the system is to a major change. Higher values mean a reconfiguration may occur soon.",
      STRUCTURAL:
        "Tracks approach to the Pre-Critical Gradient threshold. Rising RI marks coordinated drift toward systemic transition.",
      TECHNICAL:
        "RI measures global integral of PCG-aligned gradients weighted by constraint harmonics.",

    /* ---- STABILITY RESIDUE (SR) ---- */

    SR: {
      LABEL: "Stability Residue (SR)",

      INTUITIVE:
        "How much stability remains after the last shift. High SR = the system has ‘settled’. Low SR = still shaking.",
      STRUCTURAL:
        "Quantifies post-transition smoothing. Reflects the EDO (Entropic Dispersion Operator) effect after reconfiguration.",
