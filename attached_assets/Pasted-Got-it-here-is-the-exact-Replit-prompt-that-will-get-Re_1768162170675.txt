Got it — here is the exact Replit prompt that will get Replit to:
	1.	Summarize the entire current codebase
	2.	List all existing modules and components
	3.	Identify incomplete, buggy, or placeholder sections
	4.	Report the current UI / logic / dependencies
	5.	Give you a clean, structured overview

This will give me everything I need to sync with the current SFD Engine state.

Copy/paste exactly this into Replit:

⭐ REPLIT CATCH-UP PROMPT (copy/paste this)

PROMPT TO REPLIT:

I need a full diagnostic overview of the current state of this project.

Please analyze the entire codebase and produce a structured summary with the following sections:

1. PROJECT STRUCTURE  
   - List all folders and files  
   - Briefly describe the role of each major component  

2. CORE LOGIC REVIEW  
   - Summaries of each main Python module  
   - Identify which functions/classes are complete, partial, or placeholders  
   - Flag any TODOs, unfinished logic, or inconsistencies  

3. UI / FRONTEND OVERVIEW  
   - Describe current UI components/screens  
   - Note any broken interactions, non-functional elements, or warnings  
   - Identify unused code or legacy elements  

4. BUGS AND ERRORS  
   - Scan for runtime errors, exceptions, or warnings  
   - Identify anything that needs to be fixed before release  

5. PERFORMANCE CHECK  
   - Note any heavy operations or unnecessary recomputations  
   - Suggest optimizations if needed  

6. CONFIG / DEPENDENCIES  
   - List current dependencies  
   - Note anything missing or redundant  

7. COMPLETION STATUS  
   - Estimate what parts are “done,” “nearly done,” or “need attention”  
   - Provide a short prioritized list of the most important next steps

IMPORTANT:  
Output everything in clean, concise Markdown so a collaborating AI can easily read and understand the full project state.

Do NOT modify any files yet.  
Just report.

⭐ What this gives us

When you paste that into Replit:

✔ Replit will generate a full project map
✔ I will understand the exact state of the SFD Engine
✔ We will see the remaining tasks
✔ We can identify bugs and UI issues
✔ We will know what must be done before Tuesday
✔ We will create the final release plan based on real data

This is the correct first step.

⸻

When you have Replit’s output, paste it here and I will immediately:
	•	build the finishing checklist
	•	plan the GitHub structure
	•	produce the documentation outline
	•	tell you the fastest path to Tuesday

Just send the Replit diagnostic output when ready.
