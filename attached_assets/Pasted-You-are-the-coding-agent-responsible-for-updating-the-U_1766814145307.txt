You are the coding agent responsible for updating the UI/UX of the SFD Engine research simulator.  
Implement ALL of the following changes exactly as specified.

============================================================
I. GLOBAL ONBOARDING & FIRST-USE EXPERIENCE
============================================================

1. Add a subtle onboarding banner ABOVE the main visualization canvas with the text:

   “This is the structural field: each pixel represents local constraint density.”

   Requirements:
   - Small font (12–14px)
   - Muted gray (#A0A0A0)
   - No border, minimal padding
   - Banner should be visible when the simulator loads
   - Banner should fade out ONLY AFTER the user presses “Run Simulation (Apply SFD Operators)”

2. Add a small hint BELOW the canvas:

   “Press ‘Run Simulation’ to begin evolving the field. Patterns will emerge as the system reorganizes.”

   Requirements:
   - Muted gray text
   - 12px font, centered
   - Always visible in paused state

3. Change the default colormap to **Viridis** on page load.
   (Inferno remains available in the selector.)

============================================================
II. RUN BUTTON & INTERACTION CONTROLS
============================================================

4. Replace the label on the current "Run" button with:

   “Run Simulation (Apply SFD Operators)”

5. Update the tooltip to:

   “Begin evolving the field using the SFD operator cycle.”

============================================================
III. INTERPRETATION MODE & STRUCTURAL PRESETS
============================================================

6. Change the default Interpretation Mode to:

   “Field State (Raw)”

   Add tooltip:
   “View the raw evolving field before applying operator-level interpretations.”

7. Rename the dropdown labeled “Structural Presets” to:

   “Dynamic Regimes”

   Update tooltip:
   “Select a pre-configured SFD operator regime to explore characteristic system behaviors.”

============================================================
IV. METRICS PANEL RESTRUCTURING
============================================================

8. Collapse the Real-time Metrics panel by default.

9. Replace the expanded panel with a single clickable header:

   “Show Simulation Metrics”

   Behavior:
   - On click: expand to display full metrics panel
   - On collapse: hide metrics panel again
   - Optional: remember toggle state during the session (implement only if easy)

10. When expanded, ensure all metrics remain visible AND neatly grouped:
    - Structural Basins
    - Depth
    - Curvature
    - Field Energy
    - Stability
    - Variance
    - EPS
    - Step count

============================================================
V. VISUAL CLARITY, DEFAULT STATES, AND LAYOUT CLEANUP
============================================================

11. Ensure Dual View is OFF by default on page load.

12. Ensure “Show Basins” is OFF by default.

13. Reorder right-hand controls so they appear in this exact sequence:

   (1) Run Simulation button  
   (2) Colormap selector  
   (3) Show Basins toggle  
   (4) Dual View toggle  
   (5) Interpretation Mode dropdown  
   (6) Dynamic Regimes dropdown  
   (7) Metrics toggle (“Show Simulation Metrics”)  
   (8) Timeline panel (if present)

14. Add a subtle divider line between control groups for readability.

15. Make sure the left-hand panel (logs, console, code output) can be hidden or collapsed so first-time users see a clean interface.

============================================================
VI. BEHAVIORAL UPDATES & POLISH
============================================================

16. When the user presses “Run Simulation (Apply SFD Operators)”:
    - fade out the onboarding banner above the canvas
    - keep the hint text below the canvas
    - begin simulation immediately without additional clicks
    - ensure the default Viridis colormap is applied

17. If Dynamic Regimes are selected mid-simulation:
    - smoothly reinitialize OR reparameterize the solver (whichever your engine already supports)
    - update the UI to reflect the applied regime

18. If Interpretation Mode is changed mid-simulation:
    - update visualization immediately
    - do not restart or reset the simulation

============================================================
VII. FINAL VERIFICATION
============================================================

After implementing all changes:

- Ensure UI loads cleanly with no visual clutter.
- Ensure the first visible elements guide the user intuitively.
- Ensure that “Run Simulation (Apply SFD Operators)” works as before.
- Ensure no console errors appear.
- Ensure all tooltips work.
- Ensure all renamed elements update correctly across components.

Confirm visually that the user experience now follows the intended cognitive arc:
  “What is this?” → “I understand what I’m seeing” → “I know what to click” → “Oh my god.”

============================================================

Implement ALL items.
