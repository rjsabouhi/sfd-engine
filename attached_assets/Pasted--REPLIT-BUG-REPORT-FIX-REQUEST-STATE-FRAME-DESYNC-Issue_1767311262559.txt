✅ REPLIT BUG REPORT / FIX REQUEST — STATE–FRAME DESYNC

Issue Summary:
My simulation has a desynchronization between the underlying simulation state matrix and the visual frame history used by the scrubber. When I interact with the field via touch while the simulation is running, the touch-based perturbation is written into the active state array immediately, but the scrubber still plays back previously cached frames.

Because these two buffers diverge, when I scrub backward I can see future perturbations in earlier frames (ghost artifacts / premature shapes that weren’t present yet).

Expected Behavior:
Rewinding the scrubber should either:
	1.	fully rewind the underlying state to match the displayed frame, or
	2.	force the playback frames to be rebuilt from state history rather than cached images.

Actual Behavior:
The visual frames rewind, but the state matrix remains in its post-interaction modified state. This creates temporal artifacts such as circles or deformations appearing before they were created.

What I think needs to be fixed (one of these):
	•	Add a true deep-reset of the full simulation state when scrubbing to a previous frame.
	•	Or, bind the scrubber to a timeline of saved state tensors, not cached textures.
	•	Or, when the user scrubs, trigger a full re-simulation up to that timestep to ensure determinism.
	•	Or, allow manual clearing of both GPU buffer + CPU state buffer when scrubbing or pausing.

Key technical detail:
Touch events write into the simulation immediately but the scrubber does not reset the simulation buffers — only the frame texture. So the PDE solver continues from a future state while the UI shows a past frame.

Steps to reproduce:
	1.	Run the simulation.
	2.	While it is running, interact with the field using touch.
	3.	Stop the simulation.
	4.	Scrub backward to an earlier frame.
	5.	Artifact appears (e.g., a deformation or ring rendered in a frame that should not contain it).

Request:
Please fix the desync so that scrubbing backward fully resets the simulation state OR replaces cached frames with deterministic recomputed ones.

I’m happy to provide logs, code snippets, or run test builds if needed
