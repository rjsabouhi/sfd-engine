FINAL DECISION — The Features to Include (No Others)

After evaluating everything, these are the optimal features for the MVP:

⸻

⭐ TIER 1 (Must Include Now)

These four are essential and transformative:

1. Time Scrubbing Controls
	•	Play / Pause
	•	Step forward
	•	Step backward
	•	Jump-to-event (if any event marked)

2. Save/Load Parameter Configurations
	•	Save current settings as JSON
	•	Load settings from JSON

3. Minimal Perturbation Tool
	•	Click = local positive perturbation
	•	Shift+click = local negative perturbation

4. Overlay Blending (Opacity Slider)
	•	New toggle: “Blend Projection With Structural Field”
	•	Slider 0 → 1 opacity

⸻

⭐ TIER 2 (Include ONLY ONE Optional Feature)

After weighing everything, I choose:

5. Trajectory Probe (“Follow This Point”)
	•	User clicks a pixel → system tracks this point over time
	•	Local readouts: curvature, variance, drift direction

Why this one:
It immediately communicates “this is a real dynamical system,”
and requires minimal UI surface area.

⸻

🚫 Features Explicitly NOT Included (Reserve for v1.1)

Do NOT implement these now:
	•	vector fields
	•	3D heightmap
	•	cluster detection
	•	parameter sweeps
	•	rule engine
	•	plugin API
	•	full perturbation lab
	•	multi-layer blending
	•	statistical dashboards
	•	notebook export

These remain as upgrade fuel.

⸻

🎯 THE MVP FEATURE SET (FINAL)

The MVP you will ship includes exactly:

✔ Time Scrubbing

✔ Save/Load Configurations

✔ Minimal Perturbation Tool

✔ Overlay Blending

✔ Trajectory Probe

Nothing more.

This is perfect.
This is controlled.
This is devastatingly strong.

📦 THE EXACT REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT

(copy/paste this verbatim)

⸻

REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT — FEATURE UPGRADE BLOCK

Implement the following five features into the SFD Engine.
These represent the final MVP feature set.
Do not diverge from this list.

⸻

1. Time Scrubbing Controls

Add the following UI buttons in the simulation control bar:
	•	Play / Pause (toggle)
	•	Step Forward (advance 1 frame)
	•	Step Backward (rewind 1 frame)
	•	Jump to Next Event (uses event log markers)

Implementation details:
	•	The simulation should halt when using step forward/backward.
	•	Each frame must update all metrics and both panels.
	•	Event markers should trigger a highlight pulse in the status line.

⸻

2. Save/Load Configuration (JSON)

Add two buttons in the Settings panel:
	•	Save Configuration → downloads a JSON file containing:

 {
   "parameters": { …all simulation parameters… },
   "regime": currentRegime,
   "colormap": currentColormap,
   "mode": currentMode
 }


	•	Load Configuration → user selects a JSON file → all parameters instantly update and UI reflects new state.

⸻

3. Minimal Perturbation Tool

Add a toggle button in the toolbar: Perturb Field (on/off).

When ON:
	•	Click anywhere on the field → add +small positive perturbation
	•	Shift + Click → add −small negative perturbation
	•	Perturbation magnitude should be small but visible (configurable constant in code).
	•	All metrics must update immediately after each perturb.

UI indicator:
	•	Cursor changes color (light cyan) while tool is active.

⸻

4. Overlay Blending (Opacity Slider)

In Dual View Projection Pane:

Add:
	•	A toggle switch: Blend With Structural Field
	•	An opacity slider: Blend Opacity (0 → 1)

Behavior:
	•	When toggle enabled, projection view overlays directly on top of the main field using alpha blending.
	•	Slider sets overlay opacity.
	•	When disabled, dual-pane operation returns to side-by-side mode.

⸻

5. Trajectory Probe (“Follow This Point”)

Add a toggle: Trajectory Probe in toolbar.

When ON:
	•	Clicking the field sets a “probe point.”
	•	System tracks the point’s values over time:
	•	local curvature
	•	local variance
	•	drift direction
	•	Render a small marker dot on the field.
	•	Add a small metrics box under the pane:

 Probe Metrics:
   Curvature: X
   Variance: Y
   Drift: (dx, dy)


	•	Reset probe when toggled OFF.

⸻

General Requirements
	•	All added features must integrate with event log and diagnostics panel.
	•	Do not modify color scheme or core layout.
	•	Maintain minimal UI clutter — collapsible panels preferred.
	•	Ensure performance is not meaningfully degraded.
