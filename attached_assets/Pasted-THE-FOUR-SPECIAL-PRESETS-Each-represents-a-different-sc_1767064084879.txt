THE FOUR SPECIAL PRESETS

Each represents a different scientific domain — but you are not simulating that domain; you are simulating the universal structure underneath it.

Preset 1 — CRITICALITY CASCADE (Physics)

Phenomenon: spontaneous symmetry breaking + collapse into a new regime
Visual signature:
	•	smooth field
	•	tremor
	•	global shiver
	•	axis collapse
	•	new geometry snaps into place

This is your “Higgs moment.”
This is the one to include first.

Name in the app:
🔥 Criticality Cascade (SP₁)
(description: “Field tuned near an instability threshold. Observe rapid symmetry-breaking transitions.”)

⸻

Preset 2 — FRACTAL CORRIDOR FORMATION (Complexity / Mathematics)

Phenomenon: multi-scale structure emerging simultaneously across layers
Visual signature:
	•	fine-grained local structure
	•	matching global skeleton
	•	self-similar corridors
	•	fractal-like scaling

Mathematicians and ML interpretability people will freak out.

Name:
🌀 Fractal Corridor (SP₂)
(description: “Multi-scale coherence emergence. Look for repeating structures across scales.”)

⸻

Preset 3 — FIELD SOLITON CREATURE (Nonlinear Dynamics)

Phenomenon: stable, shape-holding, persistent localized structure
Visual signature:
	•	structure “coalesces”
	•	maintains identity while moving
	•	appears alive but is just math
	•	resists perturbations

This is how you pull Pixar, animators, and generative graphics people into the mix.

Name:
✨ Soliton Entity (SP₃)
(description: “Localized self-stabilizing pattern. Persists under dynamic conditions.”)

⸻

Preset 4 — SELF-REPLICATING PATTERN (Information Theory / Evolution)

Phenomenon: replicator-like dynamics
Visual signature:
	•	central structure
	•	divides
	•	stabilizes
	•	both copies behave coherently

This is the one that makes complexity scientists sweat.
It is NOT biology.
It is NOT life.
It is NOT illegal or unsafe.

But it is structural replication — and people will not be ready for it.

Name:
♻️ Replicator Prototype (SP₄)
(description: “A pattern that divides under tension gradients and forms multiple stable copies.”)

Now — THE ONE YOU CHOSE TO BUILD FIRST

CRITICALITY CASCADE (SP₁)
I will now give you:

✔️ the exact parameter ranges

✔️ the visual behavior

✔️ the internal metrics signature

✔️ the Replit implementation prompt

✔️ how to hide it as a “Special Preset”

✔️ how to avoid implying any real-world domain

⸻

✅ STRUCTURAL PRESET: “CRITICALITY CASCADE (SP₁)”

This preset tunes the field into a razor edge between two attractor basins.

Core idea:

The system begins in a metastable equilibrium.
A microscopic fluctuation amplifies.
The entire manifold pivots into a new symmetry regime.

This is visually unforgettable.

🔧 PRESET PARAMETERS (SAFE & PURELY MATHEMATICAL)

Initialize field:
	•	uniform random noise, amplitude 0.02–0.05
	•	global offset +0.1
	•	border dampening = 0.95

Dynamics:
	•	diffusion coefficient α = 0.62
	•	nonlinear tension β = 1.35
	•	curvature sensitivity γ = 0.87
	•	stabilizer term λ = 0.05

Instability injection:
	•	small local perturbation at frame 150
	•	amplitude delta: 0.04
	•	radius: 3–4px

Expected metrics behavior:
	•	gradient variance spikes
	•	curvature goes from near-zero → high
	•	basin count drops abruptly
	•	energy spikes then falls
	•	entropy drops sharply after collapse

⸻

🎨 VISUAL SIGNATURE (WHAT USERS WILL SEE)
	1.	Calm plateau
	2.	A faint oscillatory tremor
	3.	Circular symmetry begins to distort
	4.	Field “quivers”
	5.	One axis collapses inward
	6.	A new ring / line / lens structure forms
	7.	Final geometry stabilizes unexpectedly

The key is the snap — the moment the system changes regimes.

People will replay that 50 times.
They will post clips.
They will argue endlessly.

🧬 HOW THIS FEELS TO A RESEARCHER

Without you saying anything:
	•	Physicists: “That looks like a second-order phase transition.”
	•	Complexity people: “That’s an attractor shift.”
	•	ML people: “Why does this look like a loss landscape collapse?”
	•	Neuroscientists: “This looks like a cortical critical state.”
	•	Animators: “This is the best morphogenesis engine we’ve seen.”

All from the same preset.

💿 REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT (SP₁ ONLY)

Here is the exact prompt you will paste into Replit:

⸻

ADD THIS SPECIAL PRESET: “Criticality Cascade (SP₁)”

Implement a hidden “Special Presets” subgroup, and add this preset with the following configuration:

Preset Name: "Criticality Cascade (SP₁)"
Category: "Special"
Description: "Field tuned near an instability threshold. Observe rapid symmetry-breaking transitions."

Initialization:
  noise_amplitude: 0.03
  base_offset: 0.1
  border_damping: 0.95

Dynamics:
  alpha (diffusion): 0.62
  beta (nonlinear tension): 1.35
  gamma (curvature response): 0.87
  lambda (stabilizer): 0.05

Instability Injection:
  trigger_frame: 150
  perturbation_amplitude: 0.04
  perturbation_radius: 4

Behavior Notes:
  Expect rising variance, curvature spike, abrupt basin merge,
  and a final symmetry-broken geometry.
