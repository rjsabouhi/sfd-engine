Got you — here is a copy-paste-ready Replit prompt you can hand directly to the Replit agent.
This will instruct it exactly what to build: the first-time launch intro modal, safe, minimal, animated fade-in, mobile-optimized, with the text I wrote.

✅ REPLIT BUILD PROMPT — FIRST-TIME INTRO MODAL

Copy/paste all of this into Replit:

⸻

You are updating my SFD Engine mobile app.
Add a first-time-launch “Welcome Modal” exactly as described below.

1. Behavior
	•	Modal appears only on the user’s first visit (use localStorage flag like hasSeenIntro).
	•	Modal covers the screen with a semi-transparent dark backdrop.
	•	Centered card with rounded corners, soft drop shadow, and fade-in animation.
	•	Dismiss when user taps anywhere on the modal OR a small “Begin” button.
	•	After dismissal, never show again unless localStorage is cleared.

2. Modal Content

Insert the following text exactly, with clean spacing and readable font size (mobile-first):

Welcome to the SFD Engine.
A visualization tool for exploring emergent patterns in complex systems.

What you’re about to see is mathematics in motion —
flows, tensions, and attractors that unfold and reorganize in real time.

It is not alive, and it is not reacting to you.
But many people find the patterns strangely familiar because our brains
naturally recognize structure, symmetry, and change.

How to Use It
	•	Press ▶ to start the simulation.
	•	Touch & drag inside the field to add perturbations.
	•	Tap the bottom panels to explore layers, parameters, and playback.
	•	You can’t break anything. Every change simply reshapes the dynamics.

If You Feel Disoriented

Some visuals can feel immersive or intense.
If that happens, just pause the simulation and take a moment.

What This Is

The SFD Engine is a real-time emergent dynamics simulator.
It helps you see how structure forms, dissolves, and stabilizes
inside a complex system. No background knowledge required.

3. Design Requirements
	•	Full-screen overlay (position: fixed; inset: 0;)
	•	Backdrop: rgba(0,0,0,0.55)
	•	Modal card width: 85% of screen, max-width 420px
	•	Background: #0f0f0f or the app’s existing dark theme bg
	•	Text color: soft white (#e8e8e8)
	•	Headers slightly brighter (#ffffff)
	•	Line spacing 1.45 for readability
	•	Padding: 24px inside modal
	•	Border radius: 18px
	•	Drop shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)
	•	Fade-in animation for card (200–300ms ease)

4. Code Structure

Create or update:

HTML:
	•	Modal wrapper div (hidden by default)
	•	Modal card with text + optional small “Begin” button

CSS:
	•	.intro-modal-backdrop
	•	.intro-modal-card
	•	.fade-in animation

JS:
	•	Check localStorage.getItem("hasSeenIntro")
	•	If false → show modal
	•	On tap → hide modal + set localStorage.setItem("hasSeenIntro", "true")

5. Integrate Cleanly
	•	Ensure it does not interfere with the existing simulation loop.
	•	Modal should sit above the canvas and UI layers (z-index: 9999).
	•	After dismissing, user sees the normal app immediately.

⸻

When finished, output the updated HTML/CSS/JS files and confirm the modal appears only once.

That’s the complete Replit-ready build instruction.

If you want, I can also write:

✅ the exact HTML
✅ the exact CSS
✅ the exact JavaScript
so you can drop it in manually — just say the word.
