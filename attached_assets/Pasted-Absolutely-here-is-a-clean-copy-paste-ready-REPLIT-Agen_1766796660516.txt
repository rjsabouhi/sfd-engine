Absolutely — here is a clean, copy-paste-ready REPLIT Agent prompt that gives them exactly what they need to implement the Interpretation Mode system correctly, with no ambiguity.

This is written in the style that Replit Dev Agents understand best: clear requirements, explicit file changes, and expected behavior.

⸻

✅ REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (copy/paste this into Replit)

TASK:
Implement an Interpretation Mode Toggle in the SFD Engine UI.
This toggle must switch the terminology, descriptions, and UI labels used in the interface, without changing the underlying simulation logic.

⸻

1. Create an Interpretation Mode Toggle

Add a dropdown or segmented control labeled:

Interpretation Mode

Modes (exact wording):
	1.	Structural Dynamics
	2.	Energy & Stability
	3.	Attractors & Phase Space
	4.	Constraint Flow

Place this toggle prominently near the top of the right-hand sidebar, above operator controls.

⸻

2. What the Toggle Does (Core Functionality)

When the user switches modes, the simulation itself must NOT change at all.

Only the language used in the UI updates, including:
	•	operator labels
	•	tooltips / hover descriptions
	•	section headers
	•	stat panel descriptions

Underlying variable names and math remain unchanged.

⸻

3. Implement Mode-Specific Terminology (Exact Text Provided Below)

🔵 MODE 1 — Structural Dynamics

Use terminology emphasizing operators and local interactions.

Operators:
	•	Curvature → “Curvature Operator (K)”
	•	Tension → “Tension Operator (T)”
	•	Coupling → “Coupling Operator (C)”
	•	Attractor Strength → “Attractor Influence (A)”

Stats panel labels:
	•	Energy → “Field Energy”
	•	Basins → “Structural Basins”
	•	Variance → “Local Variance”

Section Header:

Structural Dynamics View
Local operators shaping global structure.


⸻

🔵 MODE 2 — Energy & Stability

Use terminology emphasizing minimization, stability, and landscapes.

Operators:
	•	Curvature → “Stability Curvature”
	•	Tension → “Gradient Tension”
	•	Coupling → “Stability Coupling”
	•	Attractor Strength → “Attractor Bias”

Stats panel labels:
	•	Energy → “System Energy (E)”
	•	Basins → “Stability Wells”
	•	Variance → “Energy Variance”

Section Header:

Energy & Stability View
A landscape evolving toward stable configurations.


⸻

🔵 MODE 3 — Attractors & Phase Space

Use terminology emphasizing phase transitions, basins, and reorganizations.

Operators:
	•	Curvature → “Phase Curvature”
	•	Tension → “Phase Tension”
	•	Coupling → “Phase Coupling Weight”
	•	Attractor Strength → “Attractor Pull”

Stats panel labels:
	•	Energy → “Phase Energy”
	•	Basins → “Attractor Basins”
	•	Variance → “Phase Variance”

Section Header:

Attractors & Phase Space View
Tracking basin formation and phase transitions.


⸻

🔵 MODE 4 — Constraint Flow

Use terminology emphasizing propagation, redistribution, constraint networks.

Operators:
	•	Curvature → “Constraint Curvature”
	•	Tension → “Constraint Pressure”
	•	Coupling → “Flow Coupling”
	•	Attractor Strength → “Constraint Bias”

Stats panel labels:
	•	Energy → “Constraint Energy”
	•	Basins → “Constraint Regions”
	•	Variance → “Flow Variance”

Section Header:

Constraint Flow View
Perturbations redistributing through constraint networks.


⸻

4. Implementation Requirements
	•	Store the selected mode in global state (React, Svelte, JS — whatever is used).
	•	Create a mapping object that maps internal variable names → label text for each mode.
	•	On mode change, re-render affected UI components.
	•	No math, simulation code, or model behavior should be altered.

⸻

5. File Changes Needed

Without knowing the project layout, typical changes will involve:
	•	/src/components/Sidebar.jsx or equivalent
	•	/src/components/OperatorControls.jsx
	•	/src/components/StatsPanel.jsx
	•	/src/state/uiStore.js or similar if using global state

Wherever text labels are currently hard-coded, convert them into dynamic references based on mode.

⸻

6. Deliverables

At completion, the app should:
	1.	Have a visible Interpretation Mode selector.
	2.	Update all relevant text instantly when the mode changes.
	3.	Preserve all operator sliders, simulation logic, and stats functionality.
	4.	Maintain aesthetic consistency with the existing dark UI theme.

⸻

7. Notes

Do not add domain-specific toggles (biology, ML, physics, etc.).
The point is to provide structural cognitive lenses, not scientific claims.
