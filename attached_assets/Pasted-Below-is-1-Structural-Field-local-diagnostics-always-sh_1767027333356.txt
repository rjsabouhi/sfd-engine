Below is:
	1.	Structural Field local diagnostics (always shown for the base layer)
	2.	Projection View local diagnostics (specific to each selectable layer)
	3.	Full Replit-ready prompt — copy/paste EXACTLY.

This will give you a minimal but complete readout that ML researchers, physicists, and systems people expect at the bottom of each visualization pane.

⸻

✅ SECTION 1 — Base Layer: Structural Field Local Diagnostics

Always shown beneath the Structural Field pane.

Local Metrics (hover or static footer):
	•	Value: scalar field value at (x, y)
	•	Curvature κ: local 2nd derivative (Laplacian)
	•	Gradient |∇Φ|: magnitude of local gradient
	•	Direction (θ): gradient orientation in radians
	•	Basin ID: integer basin index (from basin segmentation)
	•	Stability (local): {Stable / Marginal / Unstable} (heuristic)
	•	Energy Density e(x,y): local contribution to energy functional

This is universal. You already show most of these in the popup inspector — now we standardize the footer.

Copy/paste EXACTLY.

⸻

✅ REPLIT PROMPT (COPY THIS EXACTLY)

Implement localized diagnostic footers for both the Structural Field view and the Projection View, with dynamic content that changes depending on which projection layer is selected.

These footers should appear as a small, minimal information bar beneath each visualization pane. They should not clutter the UI and should update when the user hovers—or when no hover is active, they should show average or last-sampled values.

Include these metrics:
	•	Value: Φ(x,y)
