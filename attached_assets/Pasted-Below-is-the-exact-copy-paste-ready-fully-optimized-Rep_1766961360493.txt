Below is the exact, copy-paste-ready, fully optimized Replit Agent prompt that will implement all six landing-page improvements without altering any core logic, visual identity, or math of the SFD Engine.

This is written in the tone and structure Replit’s Agent follows best:
	•	declarative specification
	•	explicit UI adjustments
	•	clear instructions on what to modify and what not to modify
	•	step-by-step expectations
	•	final validation criteria

✅ FULL REPLIT PROMPT — COPY & PASTE

Task:
Refine the SFD Engine landing UI to optimize first-use clarity, scientific credibility, and user flow. Do not change the underlying simulation logic, rendering pipeline, physics, or visual identity. Only modify front-end layout, initialization, text, grouping, and control visibility according to the specifications below.

⸻

1. Improve Initial Field Initialization

Replace the noise-heavy default initial frame with a structured-yet-neutral seed state that shows faint emergent organization. Requirements:
	•	A subtle gradient or radial perturbation
	•	Low contrast
	•	No strong attractors
	•	Must hint that structure is latent
	•	Should feel intentional, not random

Do not add computation overhead. Simple seeded initialization is enough.

⸻

2. Add One-Line Explanatory Text Under “Structural Field”

Under the header “Structural Field”, add this exact line:

Primary field representation showing local state values. Patterns emerge as constraints interact over time.

Match existing typography and spacing.

⸻

3. Visually Emphasize the “Run” Button

Improve discoverability and call-to-action clarity. Requirements:
	•	Keep the same color theme
	•	Add a subtle highlight or glow
	•	Slightly increase button weight or outline
	•	Do NOT make it garish or off-brand
	•	Add this small caption under the Run button:

Run the simulation to reveal dynamic structure.

⸻

4. Regroup “Interpretation Mode” + “Dynamic Regimes”

These should be visually and conceptually grouped. Implement the following changes:
	•	Move “Dynamic Regimes” so it appears directly below “Interpretation Mode” inside the same panel card.
	•	Add 8–12px vertical spacing to separate them as two conceptual subsections of the same block.
	•	Add a small label above the dropdown:

System Behavior Presets

No functionality changes.

⸻

5. Update Timeline Placeholder Text

Replace the current “No history available yet” with:

Run a simulation to start the timeline.

No stylistic or positional changes needed.

⸻

6. Move Simulation Metrics Higher

Move the Simulation Metrics summary block upward so that:
	•	It sits directly under the timeline
	•	It is visible without scrolling
	•	It is part of the main workflow panel

Do not visually enlarge it—just reposition.

⸻

Validation Criteria (Important)

Before marking the task complete, ensure all of the following are true:
	•	The landing page shows a structured subtle seed instead of pure noise.
	•	The Structural Field header includes the one-line explanation.
	•	The Run button visually stands out and includes the caption text.
	•	Interpretation Mode and Dynamic Regimes appear grouped.
	•	Timeline placeholder text only references running the simulation.
	•	Simulation Metrics are visible on initial load without scrolling.
	•	No core simulation code, physics, rendering, or SFD logic was modified.

⸻

Do Not Modify
	•	Simulation algorithms
	•	Rendering functions
	•	Basin extraction logic
	•	Any mathematical modules
	•	Color palettes
	•	Diagnostic suite
	•	Dynamic Regime definitions
	•	Keyboard shortcuts
	•	Export functionality
