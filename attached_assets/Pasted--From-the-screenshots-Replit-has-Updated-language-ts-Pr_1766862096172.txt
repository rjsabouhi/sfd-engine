From the screenshots, Replit has:
	•	Updated language.ts
	•	Propagated the new language structure across all imports
	•	Added reactive event detection to sfd-engine.ts
	•	Added UI hooks for dynamic status narration
	•	Patched compatibility issues
	•	Updated the status line render logic
	•	Updated metrics + regime components
	•	Fully restarted & confirmed the application is running
	•	Completed all planned tasks for Phase 3

Replit is now waiting for direction on Phase 4: Validation & Tuning.

Here is the precise instruction Replit needs next, formatted exactly as a task list they can execute:

⸻

✅ NEXT STEPS FOR REPLIT — PHASE 4: VALIDATION & TUNING

Replit, proceed with the following tasks in order:

⸻

1. Validate reactive event detection thresholds in live simulation

Check the following conditions while running a simulation in each regime:

a. Variance Spike Detection

Verify that spikes are detected when
variance(t) - variance(t-12) > 0.40

b. Boundary Fracture Detection

Verify that fractures trigger when local curvature change
Δcurv > 0.15 across neighboring cells.

c. Basin Merge Detection

Use the architect-approved merge threshold:
basin_depth_difference < 0.05

d. Stability Transition Detection

Transition recognized when
variance_derivative < 0.001

Task:
Run the engine across Uniform, Multi-Basin, and Near-Critical regimes and log whether events are firing as expected.

⸻

2. Validate the status line priority system

For each detected event, check:
	•	The highest-priority event is displayed.
	•	Lower-priority messages queue correctly.
	•	First-motion lines trigger only once per run.
	•	Idle-state lines appear only after stabilization.

Task:
Simulate several transitions and confirm that the narration library is being pulled from the correct mode & regime context.

⸻

3. Validate the metrics panel’s new four-state system

Test that Intuitive Mode metrics state changes correctly among:
	•	calm
	•	unsettled
	•	reorganizing
	•	transforming

Use thresholds:
	•	calm → unsettled: variance > 0.10
	•	unsettled → reorganizing: basin_count changes
	•	reorganizing → transforming: fracture or merge event detected

Task:
Trigger each condition and confirm the displayed state updates.

⸻

4. Validate mode-aware text rendering (Intuitive / Structural / Technical)

Check the following UI elements use the correct language layer:
	•	Onboarding modal
	•	Status line
	•	Metrics panel
	•	Regime selector descriptions
	•	“Watch for” cues
	•	Idle-state descriptions
	•	First-motion narration

Task:
Switch modes and confirm all language sources change appropriately without UI errors.

⸻

5. Validate regime selector behavior

For each regime:
	•	Ensure narrative summary is displayed
	•	Ensure the “Watch for…” cue appears
	•	Ensure paused-state hint appears
	•	Ensure the regime name is using Structural Field Lexicon Layer 1 correctly

Task:
Cycle through all 7 regimes and record inconsistencies.

⸻

6. Run a full integration test (end-to-end)

Steps:
	1.	Load app
	2.	Select Intuitive Mode
	3.	Choose “Uniform Field” regime
	4.	Hit Run Simulation
	5.	Observe first-motion line
	6.	Switch to Structural Mode mid-run
	7.	Verify narration instantly recontextualizes
	8.	Trigger a basin merge event
	9.	Verify status & metrics update
	10.	Pause simulation
	11.	Verify idle-state line
	12.	Switch to Technical Mode
	13.	Verify metric labels & narration shift
	14.	Stop simulation

Task:
Report any mismatches in expected language behavior or reactive events.

⸻

7. Prepare for Phase 5 (Onboarding upgrade)

When all tests pass, notify the architect so we can proceed with:
	•	Creating a guided first-run experience
	•	Defining the “Start Here” regime
	•	Introducing vocabulary progression in onboarding
	•	Building the narrative arc for first-time users

⸻

👉 REPLIT, YOU MAY BEGIN PHASE 4 USING THE ABOVE TASK LIST.

When finished, report:
	•	Event detection logs
	•	Status line logs
	•	Mode-switch logs
	•	Any errors or mismatches
