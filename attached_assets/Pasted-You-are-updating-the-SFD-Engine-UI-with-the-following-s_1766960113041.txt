You are updating the SFD Engine UI with the following structural and functional improvements. 
Do NOT rewrite core logic — only adjust UI layout, component behavior, and projection routing.

========================================
SFD ENGINE — UI UPGRADE DIRECTIVES (v1.3)
========================================

1. DUAL VIEW LOGIC
------------------
• Dual View toggle shows/hides the right pane.
• Left pane is always the Structural Field.
• Right pane displays whichever projection is selected from the “Field Projections” dropdown.
• When Dual View is OFF:
    - Hide the right pane entirely.
    - Automatically disable or gray-out Field Projection controls.
    - Do not change the selected projection (preserve state).

2. FIELD PROJECTIONS PANEL
--------------------------
Modify the Field Projections UI exactly as follows:

• Add a header label above the dropdown:
      "Projection View"

• Move the entire Field Projections block OUT of the pane and into a small toolbar directly above the right pane.

• Update the dropdown list to include:
      - Structural (optional)
      - Curvature
      - Tension
      - Coupling
      - Variance
      - Flow Lines
      - Basins (isolated basin visualization mode)

• Give each projection a tooltip:
      Curvature: “Local bending intensity of field geometry”
      Tension: “Field gradient magnitude / stored potential energy”
      Coupling: “Interaction strength between neighboring field cells”
      Variance: “Local instability; degree of disorder”
      Flow Lines: “Directional propagation paths through the field”
      Basins: “Attractor basin segmentation based on local minima”

3. INTERPRETATION MODE PANEL
----------------------------
• Keep dropdown exactly where it is.
• Add a one-line explanation under each mode dynamically.
• Default mode should now be “Structural” (not “Intuitive”).

4. CONTROL BAR RESTRUCTURE
--------------------------
Reorganize the top control bar into the following order:

[ Run ] [ Step ] [ Reset ]
[ Interpretation Mode ▼ ]
[ Dynamic Regimes ▼ ]
[ Timeline Slider ]

• Dynamic Regimes dropdown must move UP to sit directly under the run controls.
• Timeline slider should stretch the full width of the pane below these controls.

5. DYNAMIC REGIMES
------------------
Add visual regime indicators:
   Stable         = green dot
   Semi-Stable    = yellow dot
   Drifting       = orange dot
   Collapse-Prep  = red dot
   High-Variance  = purple dot

Display the dot to the left of the regime dropdown.

6. SIMULATION METRICS PANEL
---------------------------
• Keep metrics at the bottom but group them under a collapsible panel labeled:
      “Simulation Metrics”
• Default state is COLLAPSED.
• When opened, it reveals:
      - Current timestep
      - Field energy
      - Gradient norms
      - Variance index

7. NOTEBOOK & PARAMS
---------------------
No major changes, but add a description header at the top of each tab:
      “These are the active equations and operator weights governing the field.”

8. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
-----------------------
When window size shrinks:
• Dual View should stack vertically (left on top, right on bottom).
• Control bar compresses into two rows.
• Projection dropdown shrinks but stays visible.

9. FINISHING TOUCHES
---------------------
• Add soft-hover glows on buttons (pastel accents).
• Ensure consistent padding and spacing between UI modules.
• Ensure dark-mode elements follow the SFD color palette.

Implement exactly as written. Confirm each UI change after rendering.
