Subject: Layout / viewport scaling issues in Mobile Preview – modal panels not respecting viewport, causing overlap and misalignment

Hi! I’m building a responsive web app in Replit and running into a reproducible issue that seems to come from the mobile preview renderer rather than my code. I’ve confirmed this by testing the same app outside Replit (Safari mobile inspector + actual device), where everything displays correctly.

Here is what’s happening inside Replit Mobile Preview:

⸻

1. Modal panels and bottom sheets are not respecting the safe area or viewport height

When any of my UI panels slide up (e.g., Params, Layers, Regimes), the panel’s top boundary ends up overlapping the main canvas, sometimes cutting into the rendered content by ~20–40px depending on the view.

It looks as if Replit’s preview window does not correctly calculate vh units, and therefore the panel is positioned using an incorrect viewport height.

This results in:
	•	The canvas being pushed up unpredictably
	•	The panel overlapping or sitting too close to the canvas
	•	Extra padding appearing on some screens
	•	Misalignment between the visual and controls

This happens consistently across all modal components, even though they position correctly on a real mobile browser.

⸻

2. The canvas container is being artificially expanded or compressed

When switching between tabs (Params → Layers → Run), the main visualization jumps or stretches by small but noticeable amounts — again suggesting the preview adjusts the internal height dynamically in a way real browsers do not.

It behaves like Replit is applying its own internal constraints or padding that conflicts with CSS rules like:
	•	height: 100vh
	•	bottom: 0
	•	position: fixed
	•	overflow: hidden

My layout works everywhere else except in the Replit preview.

3. The bottom navigation bar appears to consume unexpected layout space

Even when I account for safe-area insets (via env(safe-area-inset-bottom)), the Replit mobile preview seems to treat its own UI chrome as part of the viewport, which shifts elements upward.

This only occurs in the preview — not on real devices or external browsers.

⸻

4. This prevents accurate mobile layout development

Because the preview version:
	•	Overlaps UI layers
	•	Miscalculates panel heights
	•	Introduces inconsistent padding
	•	Moves the canvas unpredictably

…it’s impossible to reliably tune spacing, padding, and alignment from within Replit.

I need the preview to simulate real-world viewport behavior so I can continue developing the mobile layout accurately.

⸻

What would help

If possible, I would love:

A) Correct viewport handling in Replit’s mobile preview

(accurate 100vh, correct safe-area inset calculation, consistent layout across modal transitions)

B) An option to disable Replit’s top and bottom chrome

So the preview reflects the true browser space.

C) Confirmation on whether Replit injects any CSS or JS that affects layout

Even a small modification (like a wrapper div with padding or height constraints) could explain the behavior.

⸻

Screenshots

(I have included screenshots showing the overlap and misalignment across several interactions.)

Thanks so much — I’m building a fairly complex interactive visualization tool, and resolving this preview issue would make a big difference in ensuring the UI displays correctly on mobile devices.
