You are preparing this project for public release to the machine learning,
complexity science, and computational modeling communities. Generate all
standard high-quality open-source release documents with optimized clarity,
professional formatting, and maximum adoption potential.

Please create or update the following files in the project root:

1. README.md  
   - Title: “Structural Field Dynamics (SFD) Engine”
   - Purpose: Provide a clean, rigorous introduction that positions the tool as
     a computational framework for visualizing emergent structure in complex 
     adaptive systems.
   - Include sections:
       • Abstract  
       • Key features  
       • What the system does  
       • What the system is NOT (not a physics engine, not a predictive model)  
       • Conceptual overview  
       • Mathematical structure (moderate depth—operators, regimes, metrics)  
       • Export system explanation  
       • Installation and usage (Replit + local Python reconstruction examples)  
       • Example workflow  
       • Citation instructions  
       • Version notes  

   Tone: professional, grounded, and neutral; no hype, no overreach, no ontology claims.

2. LICENSE  
   - Use Apache License 2.0.
   - Ensure formatting matches standard Apache 2.0 template exactly.

3. CONTRIBUTING.md  
   - Provide guidelines for researchers and developers:
       • How to submit issues  
       • How to propose features  
       • Code style expectations  
       • Testing guidelines  
       • Branch naming and PR conventions  

4. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  
   - Use the Contributor Covenant v2.1.
   - Ensure the reporting instructions reference a placeholder email:
       contact@example.com (the user will update later).

5. CITATION.cff  
   - Create proper academic citation metadata:
       • title: “Structural Field Dynamics (SFD) Engine”
       • authors: Ryan Sabouhi
       • year: 2026
       • version: 1.0.0
       • doi: leave blank or placeholder
       • type: software  

   Ensure GitHub can auto-generate citation previews.

6. RELEASE_NOTES.md  
   - Provide clear version notes for v1.0.0:
       • Overview  
       • Core features  
       • Export capabilities  
       • Known limitations  
       • Roadmap for future versions  

7. Create SFD_PRIMER.md  
   - A one-page technical overview (“primer”) explaining:
       • The conceptual motivation behind the system  
       • A high-level explanation of local-rule dynamics → global patterns  
       • Why this framework is useful for researchers  
       • How to interpret visualizations  
       • Limitations and safe-use guidelines  
       • How to integrate SFD outputs into external workflows  

   This document must be formatted so the user can easily export it to PDF.

Additional instructions:
- Ensure all documents use clean Markdown formatting, proper headers, and no 
  broken links.
- Ensure the README automatically links to LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, the Primer,
  and Release Notes.
- Ensure consistency of terminology across documents.
- After generating all files, output a summary of what was created and any 
  recommended next steps for packaging, tagging, or publishing the release.

When ready, proceed to generate all files and integrate them into the project.
